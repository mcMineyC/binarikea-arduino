# Binarikea Arduino

Repo housing the hardware design files and arduino code

## This is unfinished.  I will add the schematics soon, in addition to instructions on deploying it
The models are in models/v1.  There will be a v2, since there are multiple things I need to fix (including add a power button and properly securing the back)

## Todo:
 - Implement light timer
 - Organize
 - Properly offset first run from initial seconds (eg starts at 11:05:03, wait 57 not 60 seconds)
   - Poll real time in shorter intervals?
 - Add face-up mode(s)
   - Timer
     - Dismiss
     - Set time
   - Gyro sand!!!
   - Face down is sleep
 - Alarm?
 - Power switch
